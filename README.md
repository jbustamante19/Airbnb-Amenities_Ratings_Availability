# Aribnb-Amenities_Ratings_Availability
Gathering data to explore relationship between Airbnb amenities, Ratings, and Availability

- Wrote python code to scrape Airbnb attributes such as type of place, guest numbers, bedroom number, bathroom number, etc.
- Ratings on “Accuracy”, “Check-in”, “Cleanliness”, ect. were also collected.
- Availability, price per night and other data points were also stored for all locations. 
- Exploratory Data Analysis and necessary clean up and structuring was completed using numpy and pandas libraries
- Tables are then exported as CSVs and loaded into Tableau for visualizations.
